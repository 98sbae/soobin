-- Find the categories with the biggest difference in price from previous to now.

WITH 

price_changes AS (SELECT category, (current_price - previous_price) AS change_in_price
FROM products_data
ORDER BY change_in_price asc)

SELECT category, sum(change_in_price) AS total
FROM price_changes
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total asc

-- The top 5 categories in order are:
"Meals, Entrees & Sides"
"Coffee"
"Snacks, Cookies & Crackers"
"Noodles & Noodle Soup"
"Cereal & Breakfast".

--  What products contribute the most to the top categoriesâ€™ changes in prices over time?

SELECT name, category, (current_price - previous_price) AS change_in_price
FROM products_data
WHERE category IN ('Coffee')
ORDER BY change_in_price asc

-- Looking at specific items from Meals, Entrees & Sides, it seems that products that have meats such as chicken, pork, or beef, or cheese tend to have the biggest price changes, likely due to fluctuations in prices of these ingredients.
-- For Coffee, it seems that K Cup Pods changed significantly in pricing, which may reflect sellside/market changes specifically within the K Cup Pods business.
-- For Noodles & Noodle Soup, again it seems many chicken-based products have gone up in price and that aligns with the change seen for the Meals category.
